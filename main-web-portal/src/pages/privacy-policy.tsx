          <strong>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable
          information (&#34;Personal Information&#34;) that we gather when you are
          accessing or using our Services. This policy does not apply to the
          practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals
          that we do not employ or manage.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are not of legal age to form a binding contract (in many
          jurisdictions, this age is 18), you may only use the Services and disclose
          information to us with your parent&#39;s or legal guardian&#39;s express
          consent. Review this Privacy Policy with your parent or legal guardian to
          make sure you understand it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We only collect Personal Information through the Services from a child
          under 13 where the parent or legal guardian of a child has signed up or
          been invited to sign up or approve the child to use the Services or where
          that student&#39;s school, district, and/or teacher has agreed (via the
          terms described in the Terms of Use) to obtain parental consent for that
          child to use the Services and disclose Personal Information to us. If you
          are a student under 13, please do not send any Personal Information about
          yourself to us if your school, district, and/or teacher has not obtained
          this prior consent from your parent or guardian or if your parent or
          guardian has not signed you up and given their approval for you to use the
          Service, and please do not send any Personal Information other than what we
          request from you in connection with the Services. If we learn we have
          collected Personal Information from a student under 13 without parental
          consent being obtained by his or her parent, guardian, school, district,
          and/or teacher, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal
          information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that
          information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 13
          may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph,
          please contact us at&nbsp;{contactEmail}.

          &#34;Children&#39;s Personal Information&#34; only apply to personally
          identifiable information collected from users who have registered for the
          Services as minor students (i.e., students under the age of 13). General
          references to &#34;information&#34; apply to all users.

            assets that would be transferred. Also, If we are acquired by or merged
            with another company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred
            to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may
            transfer the information we have collected, including personal
            information, to the other company.
